# DSP Package

This directory contains modular DSP components for the Mortician project:

- `windowing.py`: Window function utilities
- `bands.py`: Band edge calculation and mapping
- `envelope.py`: Envelope smoothing and dynamic gain
- `features.py`: Feature extraction (STFT, global features)
- `utils.py`: Shared helpers (placeholder)
- `__init__.py`: Main DSP API

All configuration is loaded from the project-level config.py, which reads from .env.
