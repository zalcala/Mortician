# DSP and Gain Smoothing Parameters
# Smoothing factor for the moving average of each band's energy.
# Lower = slower, more stable gain adaptation. Higher = more responsive, less stable.
GAIN_ALPHA=0.01

# Minimum allowed gain for any band. Prevents excessive boosting of quiet bands (can reduce noise).
GAIN_MIN=0.5

# Maximum allowed gain for any band. Prevents excessive attenuation/boosting of loud/quiet bands.
GAIN_MAX=3.0

# Number of frames used for the simple moving average (SMA) of each band's energy.
# Higher = smoother, more historical average. Lower = more responsive to recent changes.
SMA_WINDOW=50

# Standard DSP and network parameters
SAMPLE_RATE=48000
FFT_SIZE=1024
NUM_BANDS=32
DEVICE_INDEX=0

# UDP Settings
