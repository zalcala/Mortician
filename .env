# DSP and Gain Smoothing Parameters

# GAIN_ALPHA: Smoothing factor for the moving average of each band's energy.
# Lower = slower, more stable gain adaptation. Higher = more responsive, less stable.
GAIN_ALPHA=0.01

# GAIN_MIN: Minimum allowed gain for any band.
# Prevents excessive boosting of quiet bands (can reduce noise).
GAIN_MIN=0.5

# GAIN_MAX: Maximum allowed gain for any band.
# Prevents excessive attenuation/boosting of loud/quiet bands.
GAIN_MAX=3.0

# SMA_WINDOW: Number of frames used for the simple moving average (SMA) of each band's energy.
# Higher = smoother, more historical average. Lower = more responsive to recent changes.
SMA_WINDOW=200
